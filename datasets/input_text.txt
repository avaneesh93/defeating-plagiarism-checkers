As we enter the school, there is a playground to our left and a small garden to our right. When we enter the building, the Principalâ€™s room and the office room are to the left and the staff room to the right side. These are well furnished. There are thirty four classrooms. Our labs are well equipped. Our library has books almost on all subjects. Our Librarian is also very helpful.
